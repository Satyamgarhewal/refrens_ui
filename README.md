Hi there,

The search page UI has been completed and is ready to be tested. To test the task you can follow these steps:
1. Get the git clone repo for UI and API both and run npm i.
2. Start both the server, to start UI you can use npm start and to start the API server you can use nodemon app.js.
3. Open the browser and search for any key phrase for ex: 'John'
4. Now you can move your search result by going to the filtered list by clicking on tab button and then use up and down arrow keys in your keyboard.
5. To select any particular result click on tab keys you can see the black border arround it, it means that you have selected the list item and then press enter.
6. You will be redirected to the result page.
